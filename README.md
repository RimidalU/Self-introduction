Self-introduction


 Hi everybody! 

 Let me introduce myself.

My name is Uladzimir. I live in Minsk. 

I like technically interesting tasks, nature and travel.

I`m the beginner front-end developer, that starts his own way at rolling scopes school courses at last year.

And I have never regretted it!

 Despite a very busy program, a huge amount of unknown information, I am moving towards the goal.

Sometimes there is not enough time or knowledge, but on cross-checks you realize that you are not the only one. 

Comparing the best works with my own, I see a big pit. But remembering the preschool tasks, I can already do a lot, and this gives me confidence.

Almost all my free time from work I spend studying. Because of  this, I have no completed projects of my own. 

But still I page making sites, solve tasks on linkedin and codewars 
and deepen my knowledge in specialized courses (git, command line, flexes, js code challenges, Node.js, javascript thirty.). 

Most of the time is spent on learning English.


 I already have some knowledge of web development and I am learning new technologies to use it in their projects.

In the future, I want to front-end developer job where I will levels my skills and work on interesting for me projects.

At work that creates harmony with my family and my hobbies.

Thank you for your attention. 

Goodbye!
